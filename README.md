## What is Function Earth?
Function Earth is a React Native App that will track what we are doing around the world to reduce our footprint and preserve our environment for future generations.  Built a compost bin? Recycled? Picked up trash from the ocean? Helped the elderly? Took care of an animal? Use Function Earth to log these actions.  Race other cities, states and countries to be the greenest region in the world!

Keep a recored of the good things you do to help Earth.

## Why?
Humanity does things that ensure a healthier and lasting planet on a daily basis and those that do should be applauded and be recognized.  Function Earth is a way to do this.  Long term this app is meant to promote users to take action and clean our environment.
